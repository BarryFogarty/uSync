# uSync

uSync is a database / file syncing tool for Umbraco. It makes source control and 
deployment easier, because you only have to worry about changes on the disk - and
let uSync do all the database stuff.

## Getting uSync

The best way to get uSync is via Nuget

```bash
PM>Install-Package uSync
```

If you want you can get it from [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/usync/)
